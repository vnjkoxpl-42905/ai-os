## Local execution contract (2026-10-10)

Use this optional Workspace role only for the specific requested operations. Planning/inspection/content creation does not authorize sends, Chat announcements, invitations, cloud publication or new schedules. Use actual existing records and AI OS domain homes. Model Armor --sanitize requires verified configured template/scopes and external-payload/cost authorization; it is not proof of local privacy protection.
